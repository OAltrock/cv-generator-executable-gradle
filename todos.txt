bugs
=============================
- 0 to ... addable fields: last can be removed                                X
- index out of bounds remove addable (experience&education pages)             X
- if invalid end date and "ongoing" is selected, "ongoing" isn't saved        X
- removing the middle addable doesn't remove the remove button                X
- next can't have same validation logic in skills page (with languages)       O
- count of experiences isn't correct when deleting not the last one           O
  (getChildren().size() won't work - maybe static counter somewhere?!)

functionalities
=============================
- add buttons should be disabled if nothing can be added                      X
